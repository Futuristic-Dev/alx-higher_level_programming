# Background Context

The Airbnb project is a pivotal component of the Higher Level curriculum, serving as a comprehensive review of Python fundamentals and introducing key concepts relevant to building large-scale projects. This project covers a range of topics, from basic imports to advanced serialization techniques, and aims to prepare you for the challenges presented in the Airbnb project.

Throughout this project, you will revisit and reinforce your understanding of the following Python concepts:

- Import statements
- Exception handling
- Class creation and usage
- Private attributes and encapsulation
- Getter and setter methods
- Class methods and static methods
- Inheritance and its application
- Unit testing using the unittest module
- Reading and writing files
- Args and kwargs in function parameters
- Serialization and deserialization of classes
- JSON encoding and decoding

## Resources

To successfully complete this project, it is recommended to read or watch materials on the following topics:

- Args and kwargs in Python
- JSON encoder and decoder in Python
- Unittest module for Python testing

## Learning Objectives

Upon completing this project, you should confidently be able to explain the following concepts without relying on external resources:

### General
1. Understand the principles of unit testing and implement it in a large project.
2. Demonstrate proficiency in serializing and deserializing a Python class.
3. Write and read data to and from a JSON file.
4. Grasp the usage of *args and how to effectively apply it in functions.
5. Comprehend the purpose of **kwargs and its practical use.
6. Handle named arguments efficiently in Python functions.

This project serves as a bridge to the Airbnb project, equipping you with a solid foundation in Python and preparing you for the challenges ahead. Enjoy the learning journey!
